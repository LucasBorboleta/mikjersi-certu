The following instructions might also work on other platforms, but only Windows and Linux have been tested.

### Instructions for Linux and Windows platforms

1. Make an installation directory by either cloning this *git* repository or downloading it as a zip archive and unzipping it.

2. Move into the installation directory, where the `README.md` file seats.

3. Execute `python mikjersi_start.py` on Linux and  double-click on`mikjersi_start.py` on Windows:

   - On Windows, if needed, the first time, use `Open with ...` in order to associate `.py` file with your installed `python` interpreter.

   - The first time a Python virtual environment is created and the required dependencies are downloaded and installed; then the GUI is started. 
   - The next times, the GUI is just started.

4. For un-installing *mikjersi_certu* just remove the installation directory.
